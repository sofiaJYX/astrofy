    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      During my final year, I was selected as the project manager for a team developing an educational 2D platformer game for a real client. 
      This project presented unique challenges in stakeholder management and team leadership.
    </p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Midway through the project, we received concerning feedback: the client was unsatisfied with the product direction and felt unheard during sprint reviews. 
      The team was discouraged, and morale was low.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution & Implementation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Initiated direct communication with the client outside regular sprint meetings</li>
      <li>Conducted structured feedback sessions to identify root causes:
        <ul>
          <li>Misaligned expectations</li>
          <li>Lack of transparency</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Implemented a lightweight feedback loop:
        <ul>
          <li>Bi-weekly check-ins</li>
          <li>Updated user stories directly tied to client goals</li>
          <li>More visible backlog grooming</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Restructured sprint reviews to include demos with clear KPIs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
    <p>
      This experience taught me how clarity, empathy, and proactive communication are often more valuable than technical perfection in project success. 
      The importance of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Regular, structured communication with stakeholders</li>
      <li>Clear alignment between team activities and client goals</li>
      <li>Transparent project management processes</li>
      <li>Building and maintaining team morale</li>
    </ul>
